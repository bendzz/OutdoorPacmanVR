Outdoor Pacman VR
https://www.wanderingcrystal.com/fun-things-to-do-in-edmonton-for-adults/
> With over 50 Arcade games to choose from, you can spend the evening drinking beer and eating delicious street food while cheering on your friend as they try to flee from the ghosts in Pacman.

-Space:
	-When you hit an IRL wall, hold grip and turn and the game world will turn with you in 90 degree increments (and the game will pause).

STARTUP
-Black screen
>Yeah took some shrooms yesterday and it suddenly seemed like the best idea ever -dev
-press any button to continue

GHOSTS
https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior
-Leave ghost house to the left always

July 11 TODO
			-teleporting
-splash screen and press to continue




TODO LATER
-Ghost models:
	-They have hidden horrific mouths that open slowly as they get near, if they're facing the player's position.
	-The eyes shrink and face warps too. (blend shape all of it)
-When player respawning, it shrinks the map to be short/almost flat and tells you to walk back to the spawn point IRL.

TODO ghost audio
	-a low pulsing hum audible from a ways out.
	-Each ghost sounds different..?



TODO July 12
-Scale ghosts huge when they get near player (for fear)
-raise the walls higher when ghosts are around
-smaller audio zones
-Darker passthrough (especially the sky) for creepiness
	-A big cube (with no bottom, and inverted normals) around the play area, tinted to .75 alpha black.
-Darker blue walls
	-"light" sources from the ghosts; verts tint the ghost color as it draws near (but darker)
		-light is attentuated hard vertically so it's more around the middle of walls
		-mock HDR support? When length(light) goes well above 1 it starts turning white?
-swirly ghost distortion
	-Offset the ghost distortion in a slowly moving random pattern so the dots fly around them in different ways
	-Just a rotating offset like .3 off its center, moving along X and Y (up and sideways)?

GAMPLAY



SETTINGS
OUTPUT: 
	-A floating debug log that appears when paused or recently changed a setting
	-Always in front of player, but doesn't follow head tilt, only Y rotation (so you can look up to read old stuff)
-map scale
	-scale the map vertically to counteract this
-vertical map height (for short people)
-player speed scale
-Ghost speed scale

CONTROLS
-GRIP to lock map to headset for repositioning IRL space
	-pause game during this

(Ghost noise options)
sfx_belt_in	// bubbly noise
sine	//hum
train

 

TODO
-IRL walls
-Bug where ghosts (blinky only?) when respawning from death can just exit straight out the bottom of the ghost house lol.
-Ghosts out of bounds sometimes get stuck in the wall; try pushing them further back into the map

-pacman sounds need more reach

-Update shader to only pass to frag shader the 2 nearest lights to this pixel, by comparing the 2D screen pos of the first vertex
	-or only 1?
	-tint heavy overlaps white?




-2 Github embedded gifs: A ghost approaching life sized as you back away, and board game sized play
-Put MIT license on this and TF GJ games




TODO?
-Make background siren quieter, make death sound louder
	-Do a pushup to respawn?
		-

-lower ghost deformation zone for dots, raise it for walls
-Ghost model that morphs scary as it gets closer
	-Comes apart in the middle, teeth are shown, eyes shrink



MIXED REALITY Show Off video:
https://www.phantomhelp.com/LogViewer/Upload/?id=-1
	-get CSV
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VideoPlayer.html
	-a shader to do the greenscreen work
	-Or some random website or app to preprocess the vide https://bgrem.deelvin.com/
	
TODO:
	-Record all game data for playback in unity editor
		-Make it a separate, somewhat generic script for recording/simulating arbitrary game data
		-Press B on left controller, and it'll turn the hand red to show it's recording
		-Need ghosts, OVRrig data, game variables like Frightened and Victory for audio.
			-Ghosts need transform, direction, state, and target
			-OVRrig need rig, hands and head cam
	-load and playback the drone paths
		-Position = longitude/lattitude/height minus starting position
		-Need to interpolate between each data point.
			-Linear interpolation will be too jerky, can I do better..? Bezier curves? Quadratic interpolation..?
	-Video: 
		-recreate the edge filter for the background video
		-forground video is on a 3D texture parented to cam, with the Z/Depth adjusted so it's more vertical (look up that shader I made to fill that bus with water)
-Upload game to Sidequest for easy installation/download, download stats and sidequest publicity

-Change package name in unity/oculus dash
-Fix the floor height so walls don't warp beneath floor

	

TODO July 25th
-fix methodFrame too (to use SpeedyJson)?
-Try ReadAllInes
-Use a static Char[] array instead of a list (to speed up string processing for loading Clips, and minimize garbage collection)
	
-restart PC and pin davinci resolve to taskbar

-Record some top down gameplay, like the arcade cabinet



TODO July 29th
-Get animation recording/playback working on the camera for this last clip
-record videos of clips (using unity animations to fix up the drone sync?)




GAME FIXES:
(To do once I'm done with all these past recordings)
	-The movement multiplier needs to account for OVR rig rotation, ie map rotation! (That's what's causing all the sliding). Fuck.
		>OVRCameraRig.position = rigStartPos + Vector3.Scale(cam.transform.localPosition, new Vector3(1, 0, 1));	// this line, needs to use the OVRRig rotation to change the added localPosition or something
		-Fix the drifting error when the map is rotated!
		(Maybe add a bool to check if the playback file is an old one?)
	-J kept bumping the controller triggers and rotating the map...
		-Make that control harder to access?
		-Why does map movement make the drove nav not line up anymore? It should be fine, since it's parented to TrackingSpace
		
TRAILER MOMENTS

	-Sprinting down that long hall right after the quest tracking jerk
	-When I almost ran into Clyde, twice
	-When I wave at the drone then run down the hallway
	-When I dodge by Binky, grab the power pill and eat him
	FPS
	-When I slip on the turn near the start
	-When I chase down the blue ghosts for the first time
	-When I get too close to clyde

	-M's first person view of pumping his arms running down a hallway
	-When M's tired and walking, then looks back, sees Binky and jumps and runs
2
	-J playing
	-Maybe the start where we have a nice, low shot beside J?
	-Looking down at J running desperately, sunk into the floor, around 50s
3
	-k playing
	-CORRUPTED; their movement paths match the maze but don't line up during playback; something wrong with the recorder. Shit.
		-Need to set the TrackingSpace transform like this: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552308534906454017/1002619099928608879/unknown.png
	-Their little hand flurry at the start
	-When the drone hits the tree
	FPS:
		-They kept getting cornered by normal ghosts and even backing away from blue ghosts, hilariously
4	
	-Clip 14
	-???
	-Mystery gameplay sequence. No camera/drone recording I guess..? Good reactions though in first person
	-The constantly looking back and running at the start (in first person)
	-OH It's phone footage!
	-First 67 seconds: No video. Lots of good first person walking backwards in a panic
	:
	-when she twists the game world at 39 seconds
	-When she's jumping around panicking at the start
	-At 44 seconds when she gets cornered, they turn around and she's like "what"
		-and trying to figure things out after
	-running down the hall at 57s
	-J approaching at 75s
	-J grabbing her at the end



EMAIL:
-It took like 2 days to sync the drone footage to the game, let me know if it looks about right, or if the wall height or positions are off etc. K, your gameplay file got corrupt somehow, I was only able to recover bits of it, mb. Thx again everyone! (M, can you forward this to J?)
	-Include link to sidequest, trailer, and a dropbox with the raw drone videos


TODO FOR RELEASE:
-Make a zip file of the code from github
	-Host that and the APK in dropbox
-Make a VR Dev youtube account
	-Upload the trailer, link on sidequest
-Do another build with the fixes
	-map rotation fix TODO
	-Make sure to test that all the drone stuff is turned off and recording is on!

TODO LATER:
-replace audio system with oculus VR high fidelity audio system (or steam's, with their occlusion system?)
	-(Or just save this for another project)
-Options to disable the shader colors (at least on the dots so they're more visible)
-Anti cheat collision detection; pause and tell the player to go back when they go through a wall that would have taken more than a few tiles to get to.

-Pushup to respawn? (And reset the ghosts to the house, then turn the music back on and let them respawn once the pushup is done)

-Video background separation? NRN recommends this https://hkchengrex.github.io/STCN/ (video at bottom)
