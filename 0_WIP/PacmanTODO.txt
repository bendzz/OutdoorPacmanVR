Outdoor Pacman VR
https://www.wanderingcrystal.com/fun-things-to-do-in-edmonton-for-adults/
> With over 50 Arcade games to choose from, you can spend the evening drinking beer and eating delicious street food while cheering on your friend as they try to flee from the ghosts in Pacman.

-Space:
	-When you hit an IRL wall, hold grip and turn and the game world will turn with you in 90 degree increments (and the game will pause).

STARTUP
-Black screen
>Yeah took some shrooms yesterday and it suddenly seemed like the best idea ever -dev
-press any button to continue

GHOSTS
https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior
-Leave ghost house to the left always

July 11 TODO
			-teleporting
-splash screen and press to continue




TODO LATER
-Ghost models:
	-They have hidden horrific mouths that open slowly as they get near, if they're facing the player's position.
	-The eyes shrink and face warps too. (blend shape all of it)
-When player respawning, it shrinks the map to be short/almost flat and tells you to walk back to the spawn point IRL.

TODO ghost audio
	-a low pulsing hum audible from a ways out.
	-Each ghost sounds different..?



TODO July 12
-Scale ghosts huge when they get near player (for fear)
-raise the walls higher when ghosts are around
-smaller audio zones
-Darker passthrough (especially the sky) for creepiness
	-A big cube (with no bottom, and inverted normals) around the play area, tinted to .75 alpha black.
-Darker blue walls
	-"light" sources from the ghosts; verts tint the ghost color as it draws near (but darker)
		-light is attentuated hard vertically so it's more around the middle of walls
		-mock HDR support? When length(light) goes well above 1 it starts turning white?
-swirly ghost distortion
	-Offset the ghost distortion in a slowly moving random pattern so the dots fly around them in different ways
	-Just a rotating offset like .3 off its center, moving along X and Y (up and sideways)?

GAMPLAY



SETTINGS
OUTPUT: 
	-A floating debug log that appears when paused or recently changed a setting
	-Always in front of player, but doesn't follow head tilt, only Y rotation (so you can look up to read old stuff)
-map scale
	-scale the map vertically to counteract this
-vertical map height (for short people)
-player speed scale
-Ghost speed scale

CONTROLS
-GRIP to lock map to headset for repositioning IRL space
	-pause game during this

(Ghost noise options)
sfx_belt_in	// bubbly noise
sine	//hum
train

 

TODO
-IRL walls
-Bug where ghosts (blinky only?) when respawning from death can just exit straight out the bottom of the ghost house lol.
-Ghosts out of bounds sometimes get stuck in the wall; try pushing them further back into the map

-pacman sounds need more reach

-Update shader to only pass to frag shader the 2 nearest lights to this pixel, by comparing the 2D screen pos of the first vertex
	-or only 1?
	-tint heavy overlaps white?




-2 Github embedded gifs: A ghost approaching life sized as you back away, and board game sized play
	-social image https://github.com/bendzz/OutdoorPacmanVR/settings
-Put MIT license on this and TF GJ games




TODO?
-Make background siren quieter, make death sound louder
	-Do a pushup to respawn?
		-

-lower ghost deformation zone for dots, raise it for walls
-Ghost model that morphs scary as it gets closer
	-Comes apart in the middle, teeth are shown, eyes shrink



MIXED REALITY Show Off video:
https://www.phantomhelp.com/LogViewer/Upload/?id=-1
	-get CSV
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VideoPlayer.html
	-a shader to do the greenscreen work
	-Or some random website or app to preprocess the vide https://bgrem.deelvin.com/
	
TODO:
	-Record all game data for playback in unity editor
		-Make it a separate, somewhat generic script for recording/simulating arbitrary game data
		-Press B on left controller, and it'll turn the hand red to show it's recording
		-Need ghosts, OVRrig data, game variables like Frightened and Victory for audio.
			-Ghosts need transform, direction, state, and target
			-OVRrig need rig, hands and head cam
	-load and playback the drone paths
		-Position = longitude/lattitude/height minus starting position
		-Need to interpolate between each data point.
			-Linear interpolation will be too jerky, can I do better..? Bezier curves? Quadratic interpolation..?
	-Video: 
		-recreate the edge filter for the background video
		-forground video is on a 3D texture parented to cam, with the Z/Depth adjusted so it's more vertical (look up that shader I made to fill that bus with water)
-Upload game to Sidequest for easy installation/download, download stats and sidequest publicity

-Change package name in unity/oculus dash
-Fix the floor height so walls don't warp beneath floor

	

TODO July 25th
-fix methodFrame too (to use SpeedyJson)?
-Try ReadAllInes
-Use a static Char[] array instead of a list
	
	140 is when 31-45 nav file really starts..?
	
	
TODO
-Uninstall Wondershare Filmora? Seems pretty useless since my CPU's too old
	
	3 flytime
	
	4 lattitude
	5 longitude
	6 height
	
	18 pitch
	19 roll
	20 yaw
	21 yaw 360
	
	GIMBAL
	54 pitch
	55 roll
	56 yaw
	57 yaw 360
	
	Also has: altitude, xyz speed
	
	
TODO LATER:
-replace audio system with oculus VR high fidelity audio system (or steam's, with their occlusion system?)
	-(Or just save this for another project)
-Options to disable the shader colors (at least on the dots so they're more visible)
-Anti cheat collision detection; pause and tell the player to go back when they go through a wall that would have taken more than a few tiles to get to.

-Pushup to respawn? (And reset the ghosts to the house, then turn the music back on and let them respawn once the pushup is done)

-Video background separation? NRN recommends this https://hkchengrex.github.io/STCN/ (video at bottom)
