-Space:
	-When you hit an IRL wall, hold grip and turn and the game world will turn with you in 90 degree increments (and the game will pause).

TODO

TODO LATER
-Ghost faces the 4 directions it's walking
	-Its EYES face the target it's going toward (or straight ahead if no target)
	-They have hidden horrific mouths that open slowly as they get near, if they're facing the player's position.
-When player respawning, it shrinks the map to be short/almost flat and tells you to walk back to the spawn point IRL.

TODO ghost audio

	-Each ghost sounds different..?
