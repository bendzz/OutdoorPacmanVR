Outdoor Pacman VR
https://www.wanderingcrystal.com/fun-things-to-do-in-edmonton-for-adults/
> With over 50 Arcade games to choose from, you can spend the evening drinking beer and eating delicious street food while cheering on your friend as they try to flee from the ghosts in Pacman.

-Space:
	-When you hit an IRL wall, hold grip and turn and the game world will turn with you in 90 degree increments (and the game will pause).

STARTUP
-Black screen
>Yeah took some shrooms yesterday and it suddenly seemed like the best idea ever -dev
-press any button to continue

GHOSTS
https://gameinternals.com/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior
-Leave ghost house to the left always

July 11 TODO
			-teleporting
-splash screen and press to continue




TODO LATER
-Ghost models:
	-They have hidden horrific mouths that open slowly as they get near, if they're facing the player's position.
	-The eyes shrink and face warps too. (blend shape all of it)
-When player respawning, it shrinks the map to be short/almost flat and tells you to walk back to the spawn point IRL.

TODO ghost audio
	-a low pulsing hum audible from a ways out.
	-Each ghost sounds different..?



TODO July 12
-Scale ghosts huge when they get near player (for fear)
-raise the walls higher when ghosts are around
-smaller audio zones
-Darker passthrough (especially the sky) for creepiness
	-A big cube (with no bottom, and inverted normals) around the play area, tinted to .75 alpha black.
-Darker blue walls
	-"light" sources from the ghosts; verts tint the ghost color as it draws near (but darker)
		-light is attentuated hard vertically so it's more around the middle of walls
		-mock HDR support? When length(light) goes well above 1 it starts turning white?
-swirly ghost distortion
	-Offset the ghost distortion in a slowly moving random pattern so the dots fly around them in different ways
	-Just a rotating offset like .3 off its center, moving along X and Y (up and sideways)?
